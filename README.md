## Update Notes:
We release early alpha now. This is EU only for the time being (sorry NA, you'll have to wait for elin gunners). Currently many features are planned, I just wanted to get this out there for people that want it due to a lack of free alternatives.

## How to:
- Download the prepackaged script from the [releases tab](https://github.com/hugedong69/arborean-apparel/releases)
- Extract/paste contents of the .zip into your `/tera-proxy` directory, overwriting when asked.
- Run `installer.bat`, wait for it to finish
- Start tera-proxy normally

If this doesn't work or isnt' clear, hit me up @@@@ Pentagon#0099 on discord.

### Commands:
To open the UI type `aa open` into /proxy or `!aa open` into a normal chat. There are other commands but everything is controlled through the UI and I'm probably going to delete them because I hate ease of use.

### Online:
By default Apparel will share your costume selections with other people using the module around you by connecting to an external server. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, simply edit index.js and change `online: true` to false.

The server is run by me for free, if you want your own special server for your guild or something, hit me up. Server software is also on this github if you don't trust me at all. This only affects the costume sharing aspect.
