## Update Notes:
We release early alpha now. This is EU only for the time being (sorry NA, you'll have to wait for elin gunners). Currently many features are planned, I just wanted to get this out there for people unwilling to pay $15 for a module that requires you to type things and has an high risk of getting people banned.

## How to:
Download the prepackaged script from the [releases tab](https://github.com/hugedong69/arborean-apparel/releases) otherwise you will be missing icons and other data. Download minor script updates from the repo. I may add the icons required to make the script work to the repo but then again I might not.

To install, simply extract the prebuilt folder into your tera-proxy main directory, then run `installer.bat`, wait for it to finish, then run `TeraProxy.bat`.

Requires electron to be installed and proxy to be run as electron, the supplied scripts in the prepackaged version should hopefully do this. If not hit me up on discord. 

### Commands:
To open the UI type `aa open` into /proxy or `!aa open` into a normal chat. There are other commands but everything is controlled through the UI and I'm probably going to delete them because I hate ease of use.

### Online:
By default Apparel will share your costume selections with other people using the module around you by connecting to an external server. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, simply edit index.js and change `online: true` to false.

The server is run by me for free, if you want your own special server for your guild or something, hit me up. Server software is also on this github if you don't trust me at all. This only effects the costume sharing aspect.
